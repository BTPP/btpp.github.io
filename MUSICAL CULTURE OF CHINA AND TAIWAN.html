        <h1 class="style10">MUSICAL CULTURE OF CHINA AND TAIWAN</h1>
        <p class="style9">A wise ancient Chinese  philosopher named Confucius said that music has the power to make people behave  well or not so well. The people of China have always believed that music could  help make daily life better. So music is an important part of school and public  life in Chinese culture.  <img src="http://www.chinaodysseytours.com/tours/pictures/15-days-China-Golden-Route-with-Silk-Tour/daybyday/Tang_Dynasty_Show13_f.jpg" alt="" width="188" height="160" align="right"/> <br />
          <br />
          China is a very large country in the far eastern part of Asia. Taiwan is an  island off the southeastern coast of China. Chinese people and their culture  have been in Taiwan for several centuries. Taiwan has sometimes been considered  a part of China, and at other times has been independent of China.  The musical traditions of China and  Taiwan are entwined, and are among the world’s oldest.  <img src="http://blog.taiwan-guide.org/wp-content/uploads/techung-tibet-taipei.jpg" alt="" width="191" height="157" align="right"/> <br />
  <br />
          Along with Chinese music and culture, the original  folk traditions  and music of Taiwan are still thriving there, especially in the mountain  regions. Vocal music is very important to the mountain people of Taiwan, since  it is one way that they preserve their history and traditions. They sing their  history to younger generations, since they have not had a written language. The  original people of the plains regions of Taiwan have mixed their musical  traditions more with the music of China, so we know less about what their music  was like before Chinese people came to Taiwan.  <img src="http://traditions.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/upload/upfiles/2009-01/07/culturalchina3a6741adae8a718b7dd7.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="231" align="right"/> <br />
  <br />
          Chinese traditional music is based on the pentatonic scale. The meter is  usually duple, and the rhythm is not very complex. As is true in many large  countries, the music of China varies from region to region. The differences  between vocal styles are related to the differences in language. Mandarin is  the language spoken by most of the people in China. Each person in the rest of  the population  speaks one of over 60 different  languages! Each language group has its own style of song and musical theater.</p>
        <p class="style11">Traditional  Chinese instrumental pieces are mostly short and are based on stories and  legends, nature, or true events. There are pieces for solo players and pieces  for groups of three to twelve players. The player of each instrument ornaments  a basic melody. There is a strong timbre contrast between instruments.</p>

          Traditional Chinese instruments include: <em><strong><img src="http://www.foreigners-in-china.com/images/chinese-musical-instrument-pipa.jpg" alt="" width="157" height="167" align="right"/></strong></em></p>

        <li class="style12"><em><strong>Woodwinds: bamboo flute, recorder-like bamboo flute, and bamboo panpipes</strong></em></li>
        <li class="style12"><em><strong>Percussion: a variety of large and small drums, normally played with beaters, and a  variety of gongs, cymbals, and clappers   <br />

        <p class="style9"><strong>Peking Opera</strong>  is a type of Chinese musical  theater. The plots for these operas are based on popular legends, historical  events, and literature. In this kind of opera the costumes and makeup are  fancy, the set design is simple but colorful, and the actors use symbolic  gestures and movements and sing in a high range with an intense quality. A band  that is made up of traditional Chinese instruments, including pitched gongs,  accompanies this singing.</p>
        <p class="style9">Traditional music is still  performed and listened to, though it is usually somewhat modernized. The  traditional Chinese instrumental group has grown into an orchestra. With  harmony now a regular part of the music, instruments of lower pitch have been  developed to carry the bass line. The Western cello and bass are also used.  Older music is arranged for these new instrument groupings, and newly-composed  pieces are included, as well.  <img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/1/280512_db17e1fb12.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="228" align="right"/> </p>
        <p class="style9">In Taiwan  modern styles of  pop and art music have developed more quickly since the tough laws and limits  of the People’s Republic have not been in such force. Hong Kong’s pop music is  also an important part of the music scene in China today are seemingly endless </p>

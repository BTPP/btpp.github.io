      <blockquote>
        <p class="style9">Geographically,  Israel is part of the Middle East; its musical heritage is historically related  to Arab, Persian, Turkish, and North African traditions. However, its history  of immigration in the last century has made its musical profile very different  from that of its Middle Eastern neighbors. Israel as a country is rather new,  established in 1948 as an official Jewish state. When the state was established, music  was recognized as an important element: It has the power to bring diverse  immigrant groups together and can function as a way to form a national identity.</p>
        <p class="style9">Each  immigrant group brought the traditions of the homeland, including music. Since  there were many fine musicians and composers among the early immigrants from  Europe, Western classical music became well known and widely performed in  Palestine. At that time,  urban musical life was similar to that in European cities, with orchestra  concerts, vocal and instrumental solo and ensemble recitals, European-style  musical theater and cabaret shows, and many styles of popular music. Indigenous  and traditional Arabic music continued to be performed by established poets and  musicians. Immigrants also brought their own folk and composed music.   European immigrants  brought a strong choral tradition to Israel. It continues to this day with  numerous community, symphonic, and childrenâ€™s choirs performing throughout the  country. Israel has hosted the Zimryia- world choral festival every three  years since 1952.  <img src="http://www.el-funoun.org/gallery/gall23a.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="209" align="right"/> <br />
          <br />
          The  1960s and 1970s saw a rise in folk music with texts reflecting the political  and social times. It was during this time that numerous songs about Jerusalem  and peace appeared</p>
        <p class="style9">The  global spread of rock music in the 1960s affected this tradition as well; the  new folk music took on the characteristics of rock and was accompanied by  electric organ, drums, guitar, and bass guitar</p>
        <p class="style9">Along  with the ongoing and pervasive European influence on Israeli musical life,  there has been an ongoing desire by some to return to pre-European,  Middle-Eastern roots. The 1950s saw influences of Iraq and Egypt in popular  music; the 1960s saw Arabic and Greek influences.<br />
          <br />
        In the 1980s a style known as &quot;eastern  Mediterranean&quot; developed, incorporating melodies in modes and with  ornamentation that sound Middle Eastern but with accompaniment built around  electric guitar, bass guitar, and drum set. This is yet one more addition to  the many musical styles found in Israel today.</p>

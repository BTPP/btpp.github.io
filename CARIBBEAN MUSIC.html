          <span class="style11">Caribbean folk and popular music are a mixture of West African and European (primarily Spanish) influences. West Africans who were  brought as enslaved people to the islands of the Caribbean made music with  percussion instruments such as drums, bells, and shakers. They brought their  unique musical style elements as well: special tempo-setting rhythms (time  lines) played by claves or bells, multi-layered and syncopated rhythms, and  songs in call-and-response formats. Europeans brought with them the guitar,  Spanish dance forms, and a Western European use of harmony.  <img src="http://www.visailing.com/articles/caribbean-bareboat-charter/caribbean-bareboat-charter-images/caribbean-music.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="147" align="right"/> <br />
          <br />
          The styles of Caribbean music vary from island to island. In Cuba, the most important style of music is the <em>son</em> (sohn), a rural  style of songs for dancing. It includes mambo dance music, among others. The  ending of most Cuban <em>sones</em> features a quick alternation between a  soloist improvising a &quot;call&quot; and the rest of the group playing and  singing the &quot;response.&quot; Another popular Afro-Cuban dance is the <em>rumba,</em> which became popular as an American ballroom dance in the 1930s.</span><br />
          <br />
          <span class="style9">The Dominican merengue is a dance form that is also popular in Puerto  Rico, Haiti, and Venezuela. Accordions, drums, and marimba are frequently used  in ensembles that play merengue dance music.<br />
          <br />
          Jamaican reggae, popularized by a group called Bob Marley and the  Wailers, was preceded by styles called ska and rock steady.  <img src="http://www.rousefamily.com/rock_roots/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/BobMarleyWailers2.jpg" alt="" width="312" height="205" align="right"/> <br />
          <br />
          Puerto Rican musical styles include the bomba, which uses a  call-and-response format and has drum accompaniment, and the plena, which is a ballad (story song) style similar to some found in Mexico.<br />
          <br />
          Calypso developed mainly in Trinidad and Tobago. It is a popular style  of song that often contains comical social criticism and satire. A less  well-known style is tamboo bamboo, which involves using stamping tubes  made of bamboo. Trinidad and Tobago are also known as the birthplace of steel  drum bands.</span></p>
        <p class="style10 style15">CARIBBEAN MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</p>
        <p><span class="style13">Conga  drums: Cuban  barrel-shaped, one-headed hand drums, played in sets of two to four<br />

          Timbales: a set of two one-headed metal shelled drums played with  a stick    <br />
          Steel drums: also known as     &quot;pans,&quot; are made from oil drums  heated and hammered into an instrument with multiple pitches played with  rubber-headed mallets. Steel drums are often played in bands of many  instruments.<br />
          Claves: concussion sticks made of Cuban hardwood, which often play a  time line, or tempo-setting rhythm    <br />
          Maracas: gourd rattles played in pairs throughout Latin America    <br />
          Guiro: a notched hollow gourd played with a stick    <br />

          </span><br />
          <span class="style13">Other instruments used in the Caribbean Islands today include the violin,  electric bass, acoustic bass, trumpet, trombone, saxophone, and the six-string  Spanish guitar. </span></p>

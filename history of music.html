    <h1 class="style8"> HISTORY OF MUSIC</h1>
    <p class="style7">Music history, sometimes called historical  musicology, is the highly diverse subfield of the broader discipline of musicology  that studies the composition, performance, <img src=images/p13366[1].jpg alt="" width="173" height="201" hspace="12" align="right" />reception, and criticism of music  over time. Historical studies of music are for example concerned with a  composer's life and works, the developments of styles and genres (such as  baroque concertos), the social function of music for a particular group of  people (such as music at the court), or the modes of performance at a particular  place and time (such as the performance forces of Johann Sebastian Bach's choir  in Leipzig).</p>
    <p class="style7">In theory, &quot;music  history&quot; could refer to the study of the history of any type or genre of  music (e.g., the history of Indian music or the history of rock). In practice,  these research topics are nearly always categorized as part of ethnomusicology  or cultural studies, whether or not they are ethnographically based.</p>
    <p class="style7">The methods of music history  include source studies (esp. <img src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSbw93NdnpAHOHkT7mMomy_DDNRbjxoEUSvMY2RgTrbsEySFuXM" alt="" name="rg_hi" width="207" height="146" align="right" id="rg_hi" data-width="255" data-height="198" />manuscript studies), paleography, philology  (especially textual criticism), style criticism, historiography (the choice of historical  method), musical analysis, and iconography.</p>
    <p class="style7"> The application of musical analysis  to further these goals is often a part of music history, though pure analysis  or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be seen in  the field of music theory. </p>
    <p class="style7">Some of the intellectual products of music  historians include editions of musical works, biography of composers and other  musicians, studies of the relationship between words and music, and the  reflections upon the place of music in society.</p>
    <p class="style7">Music is found in every known culture, past and  present, varying wildly between times and places. Around 50,000 years ago,  early modern humans began to disperse from Africa,  reaching all the habitable continents. Since all people of the world, including  the most isolated tribal groups, have a form of music, scientists conclude that  music is likely to have been present in the ancestral population prior to the  dispersal ofhumans around the world. </p>
    <p class="style7">Consequently music may have been in  existence for at least 50,000 years and the first music may have been invented  in Africa and then evolved to become a  fundamental constituent of human life. </p>
    <p class="style7">A culture's music is influenced by all other aspects of that culture,  including social and economic organization and experience, climate, and access  to technology. </p>
    <p class="style7">The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in  which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward music players  and composers all vary between regions and periods. &quot;Music history&quot;  is the distinct subfield of musicology and history which studies music  (particularly Western art music) from a chronological perspective. </p>
    <p class="style7">A famous Tang Dynasty guqin, &quot;Jiu Xiao Huan Pei&quot;.  It has been played since ancient times, and has traditionally been favored by  scholars and literati as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement. </p>

      <h1 class="style10">MUSICAL CULTURE OF JAPAN  <img src="http://www.soygrowers.com/library/japan50/day4/asa-50C.jpg" alt="" width="239" height="192" align="right"/> </h1>
      <p class="style10"><span class="style11">The  musical life of Japan today is very much like that of North America and Europe,  with all of the familiar popular music, in addition to symphony orchestras,  period instrument ensembles, performance art, and opera. Arts groups from all  over the world come to Japan on tour to perform. Traditional styles associated  with Japanese identity are still present, however, and are enjoying renewed  vigor after long being overshadowed by Western influences. Japanese traditional  music includes both art and folk styles.</span></p>
      <p class="style10"><span class="style12">CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRADITIONAL JAPANESE ART MUSIC</span> <img src="http://www.japan-photo.de/HONODAIKO.jpg" alt="" width="265" height="156" align="right"/> </p>
      <p class="style9">Melodies  based on pentatonic scales are the most important element in Japanese music.  Unlike Western art music, harmony does not exist in Japanese art music.<br />
        <br />
Ensembles are often made up of just a few instruments, each  with its own timbre. Each part in an ensemble performs a slightly different  version of the same melody in this transparent texture The way a Japanese  instrument is played,including gestures ,is as important as the quality of its  sound.   <img src="http://www.jmusic.com/images/jmp3.jpg" alt="j mp3" width="135" height="173" align="right"/></p>
      <p class="style9">A steady beat is often not present in traditional Japanese  art music, but when it is present, it tends to be in duple meter and never goes  very fast. The whole idea of rhythm is flexible, and traditional Japanese  musicians are known for their skill in ornamenting a melody or rhythm.   </p>
      <p class="style9">One  of the oldest styles of music currently being performed is the Japanese  traditional court music  known as <em>gagaku</em>.  People in Japan have been performing <em>gagaku</em> since the fifth century!  This musical style is also used for Shinto religious ceremonies. <em>Gagaku</em> instrumentation includes winds, plucked strings, and percussion.  <img src="http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/culture/gagaku/img/08ph-02.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="169" align="right"/> </p>
      <p class="style9">Many Japanese people  studied and mastered Western art and pop music in every aspect during the  twentieth century. Beginning in the 1990s, however, the government of Japan  decided to increase the teaching of traditional Japanese music in the schools.  Now each middle-school student in Japan is required to learn to play at least  one Japanese instrument. Recently many Japanese young people have become  interested in popular music from Singapore, Indonesia, and Africa. Balinese and  Javanese gamelan study is available in universities in Japan, as well. </p>

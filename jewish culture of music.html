      <h1 class="style10">JEWISH CULTURE OF MUSIC</h1>
      <p class="style10"><span class="style11">Jewish  music continues to exist wherever there are Jews, which is almost everywhere in  the world. Jewish music is as vast and varied as all the music in the world.  There are Jews living in countries as diverse as India, Russia, Europe, Asia,  Ethiopia, America, Argentina, Australia, and Israel.</span> <img src="http://www.yurope.com/org/HorBracaBaruh/hor5.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="170" align="right"/> </p>
      <p class="style10"><span class="style11">Music  has a central place in Jewish life both in the synagogue and home. Liturgical  music, holiday music, and Jewish folk music have often been based on folk  melodies found in the particular country in which Jews settle. Jewish music typically incorporates musical ideas and styles from all the  countries in which Jews have settled as well as the stylistic elements of the  countries from which they may move. The music is often passed down in the oral  tradition from one generation to the next without musical notation.  Jewish songs can be in Hebrew, English, Yiddish, Ladino and Arabic.</span></p>
      <p class="style10"><span class="style11"><strong><em>Nigunim</em></strong> (songs without words) are customarily sung by Orthodox and Chassidic  (ultra-orthodox) Jews around the table after Sabbath or festive meals. Although there is much emphasis on vocal music in Judaism, there is  also instrumental music without accompanying text. For hundreds of years, <em>klezmer</em> groups have played for all kinds of festivities and ceremonies in Eastern European  Jewish life. <em>Klezmer</em> music reached a peak in Prague in the Czech  Republic, in the mid-1400s. Traveling <em>klezmer</em> musicians were sought for  Jewish as well as Christian festivities. Although <em>klezmer</em> music’s  popularity declined in the last century, <em>klezmer</em> bands have once again  become popular in the United States and parts of Europe and Israel.</span> <img src="http://multimedia.jta.org/images/multimedia/zamir-choir_0/singers_2010_1_1_m.JPG" alt="" width="230" height="170" align="right"/> </p>
      <p class="style10"><span class="style11">Music  plays a central role in Jewish religious life. There are several different  religious branches within Judaism, each one with its own musical traditions. The  primary ones are Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform. In Orthodox Judaism, only  men sing in synagogue. Instruments are not permitted in the synagogue during  Sabbath services or religious observances, except for the <strong><em>shofar</em></strong> (a ram’s horn), which is blown on the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah (The  Jewish New Year). Within the Conservative and Reform movements in Judaism,  women play a more central role, singing in synagogue choirs and serving as both  rabbis and cantors. In most Reform and some Conservative synagogues instruments  such as organ and guitar are played on the Sabbath to accompany singing.</span></p>

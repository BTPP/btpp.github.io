      <h1 align="left" class="style10">MUSICAL CULTURE OF MIDDLE EAST</h1>
      <p align="left" class="style10"> <span class="style11">There are four cultural groups: Arab,  Persian, Turkish, and North African Maghribi. These groups experience music in  similar ways in classical traditions and in some folk and popular styles too. Within  this vast region there are many different ways of experiencing music and more  than a few contradictions.</span> <img src="http://www.payvand.com/news/07/feb/Academy-of-Maqam.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="189" align="right"/> </p>
      <p align="left" class="style10"><span class="style11">Islam  is the predominant religion in the Middle East, and it allows a limited amount  of music-making. Two other world religions practiced in this area but not  discussed here are Judaism and Christianity. The unaccompanied, non-metric  chanting of the Koran  is to Western minds considered  singing, but it is not technically considered singing, or even music, by  fundamentalist followers of Islam in the Middle East . This kind of music is extremely important in Islam,  especially in mystic sects, and a stunningly vast and complex musical system of  using melodic and rhythmic modes in ancient chant with improvisation is in  place to inspire each worshipper.</span> <img src="http://ngeteh.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/gamelan_gong_gede.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="187" align="right"/> </p>
      <p align="left" class="style10"><span class="style11">Certain  kinds of poetry may be sung in formal situations, sometimes with instrumental  accompaniment. This is frowned upon by some Muslims, but allowed by many Though the styles called &quot;classical&quot; are  for entertainment, they are accepted by many Muslims because there is in them a  connection with intellectual elements, especially in the area of mathematics.  The highest level of disapproval extends to popular music, and especially that  used primarily for dancing.</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="style10"><span class="style11">  There are specific musical roles for Muslim women, which traditionally are part  of private family life and not heard outside the home.  Women are recognized as vocalists in both  classical and popular music but rarely play instruments.</span> <img src="http://wwwdelivery.superstock.com/WI/223/1792/PreviewComp/SuperStock_1792-88920.jpg" alt="" width="179" height="251" align="right"/> </p>
      <p align="left" class="style10"><span class="style11">Middle  Eastern music is based on special scales called &quot;modes,&quot; which vary  from place to place. These modes use quarter tones in addition to half steps  and whole steps. In terms of rhythm, the music is organized into beat  groupings, with patterns of stressed and unstressed beats. There are many, many  such established patterns, and they are extremely complex. The forces of a  classical performance might range from one melody with a drum to a large  ensemble of three to twelve musicians, including strings , wind instruments, one or more types of drum, and  one or more singers. The timbre tends to be somewhat flat, rough and nasal,  without vibrato. This music favors higher pitches as opposed to lower pitches.  The men of this region like to sing at the top of their range. Middle Eastern  melodies usually move by step and are highly ornamented, and the various  musical parts move independently.</span></p>
      <p align="left" class="style10"><span class="style11">Middle  Eastern pop musicians have mixed Western instruments and harmonies with  traditional instruments, rhythms, and melodies. International pop styles such  as rap, hip-hop, and rock have had an influence on Middle Eastern music.  Some people  now voice their opinions about political struggles through music. Music the  world over has often served this purpose.<br />

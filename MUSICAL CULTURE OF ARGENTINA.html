        <h1 class="style10">MUSICAL CULTURE OF ARGENTINA</h1>
        <p class="style10"><span class="style11">The South American country  of Argentina is home to a variety of musical styles and traditions. Many of  them are the result of a blending of indigenous and immigrant cultures. Spanish  colonists arrived in the 1500s, and another big wave of immigrants (mostly  Spaniards and Italians, and some people from France, Germany, Great Britain,  and Poland) came from the 1870s to the 1940s. Africans were brought to  Argentina by Spanish colonists to work as slaves, but their numbers were  greatly diminished during a yellow fever epidemic in 1871. Descendents of immigrants  make up about 85% of the population of Argentina today. As a result, art music  in Argentina has followed patterns similar to those in Europe since the 1500s.  <img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_IQZsqeq6QP8/S_5ZVgW5axI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/JUi49g01164/s1600/Bandoneon.jpg" alt="" width="239" height="171" align="right"/> <br />
          <br />
          European-influenced music of Argentina includes Catholic musical traditions  from Spain and Italy. This includes liturgical music as well as music for  celebrating saint days and holidays. European Protestants brought their music  with them to Argentina in the 1900s. Many European church musicians taught  indigenous peoples to play and even construct European instruments. Some  indigenous groups have always considered music and musical instruments to have  supernatural powers for communicating with their own deities. This may be why  they were open to learning about foreigners’ ways of making music, even if they  did not accept the religious teachings that went with them.</span></p>
        <p class="style10 style12">FOLK MUSIC</p>
        <p class="style10"><span class="style11">There are two main kinds of  folk music heard almost everywhere in Argentina. One is music that comes from  original indigenous cultures (there are many), and the other is creole music  that has evolved from the culture of the Spanish colonists and their  descendants, often mixing with local original traditions. European dances,  popular songs, religious music, instruments, and festivals such as Carnival  were brought to Argentina by immigrants, and have evolved into the creole music  enjoyed today.</span></p>
        <p class="style13">SOME OF THE FAMOUS ARGENTINA MUSICIANS  <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2009/10/5/1254741980458/Mercedes-Sosa--001.jpg" alt="" width="206" height="141" align="right"/> </p>
        <p class="style10"><span class="style11">The folk singer <strong>Mercedes  Sosa</strong> (born 1935) interprets folk traditions of Argentina as well as folk  traditions found throughout Latin America. Sent into exile by Argentina’s  military regime in 1978, she returned five years later to a heroine’s welcome.</span></p>
        <p class="style10"><span class="style11"><strong>Alberto Ginastera</strong> (1916–1983) started out composing in the nationalist style popular in  Argentina in the early twentieth century. He turned to composing neoclassical  pieces in the 1950s and switched to atonal and serialist compositions in the  1960s. He was recognized as a major composer in Argentina, the United States,  and Europe</span></p>

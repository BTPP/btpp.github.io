      <h1 class="style10">MUSICAL CULTURE OF SCOTLAND AND IRELAND</h1>
      <p class="style11">THE GAELIC MUSIC</p>
      <p align="left" class="style9">The  Gaels are one of the Celtic peoples of Ireland, the Scottish Highlands, and the  Isle of Man. The best-known type of Gaelic song is the ballad, or story song.  Both Scottish and Irish ballads are often sung unaccompanied and in an  ornamented style. Ornamentation is one of the most prominent features of both  Scottish and Irish Gaelic music, and the best singers and instrumentalists are  identified by their skill in applying just the right trills, grace notes, and  bends. In the 1890s, Francis James Child collected five volumes of texts of  Scottish and English ballads, and in the 1960s, Bertrand Bronson collected the  tunes that went with them. Today these songs are called the &quot;Child  ballads,&quot; after their collector.  <img src="http://www.clandonaldgatherings.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/istock_000009768636small_edited-1.jpg" alt="" width="186" height="148" align="right"/> <br />
        <br />
        The Gaelic song tradition dates back to the Middle Ages. The  Heroic Ballads were poetic stories about battles and great deeds, sung by  Celtic minstrels. Most Gaelic poetry was intended to be sung, so it was  preserved through oral tradition, and not written down. Because these ballads  were not written down, many of them have been lost.<br />
        <br />
        Lullabies and work songs have also been a part of Gaelic  music making. Work songs were commonly sung to accompany tasks such as grinding  corn, milking cows, and spinning.  <img src="http://mumaharps.com/harps/xharp/images/harp29.jpg" alt="" width="193" height="207" align="right"/> <br />
        <br />
&quot;Mouth music&quot; is a Scottish style of singing.  Nonsense rhymes and meaningless syllables are sung to the music of instrumental  dance tunes, such as reels. When this is done very quickly, it is quite  entertaining. An Irish form of mouth music is called &quot;lilting&quot; or  &quot;dydeling.&quot;</p>
      <p class="style11">INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC</p>
      <p class="style11 style12">Bagpipes   are   considered the primary national instrument. Scottish pipes have a nine-note  chanter, two tenor drones and a bass drone. The chanter is the recorder-like  part of the instrument with nine holes fingered by the bagpipe player. A drone  is a pipe that plays one continuous note.Irish  bagpipes, called <em>uilleann</em> pipes, are smaller and quieter than Scottish  pipes and can be enjoyed indoors. The chanter on modern Irish pipes has a range  of two octaves.  <img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_I4w-M7igu6w/S7oSDQOHuQI/AAAAAAAAAcA/DpAzow3pn28/s1600/bagpipes.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="250" align="right"/> <br />
      </p>
      <p class="style9">The  fiddle is an important element in Scottish folk music. Scottish fiddling is a  famous tradition. The Scottish fiddle’s repertoire includes dance tunes, such  as reels, jigs, and waltzes, as well as music for listening. Irish fiddling has a wide variety of styles that vary from  county to county. The fiddle is a mainstay of every Irish band that plays for  dances.</p>
      <p class="style9">Both  the Scots and the Irish play harps. These harps have strings made of either  wire or nylon. They were once made of gut, or cord made from animal intestines.</p>
      <p class="style9">Accordions and  concertinas are common in both Scottish and Irish music, as well. Other Irish  instruments are whistles, flutes, and drums. The Irish tin whistle, also called  a pennywhistle, is a diatonic instrument that is designed to play in one key,  such as C or D.   The Irish flute is made of wood and has open holes and sometimes a couple of  metal keys. This flute is often a featured instrument in Irish traditional  music.<br />
        <br />
    The Irish <em>bodhrán</em> is a low-toned frame drum held by a  cross frame and played with a small double-ended stick. The <em>bodhrán</em> is  commonly played in dance bands with fiddles, guitars, mandolins, whistles or  flutes, and concertinas </p>

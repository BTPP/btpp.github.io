        <h1 class="style10">APPALACIAN CULTURE OF MUSIC</h1>
        <p class="style9">Music has always been at the center of life in Southern Appalachia. The people  of this region are descendants of Scottish-Irish, English, Welsh, German, and  French settlers who came across the Atlantic 200 years ago, as well as people  of African American and Cherokee heritage. An oral musical tradition came with  these people, many of whom were laborers, servants, and farmers. Because the  southern Appalachian settlements were isolated from other groups of people by  the mountains, their music did not change very much over hundreds of years.  <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Virginia-stringband-1937.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="221" align="right"/> </p>
        <p align="left" class="style9">Southern Appalachian  melodies are usually diatonic or modal and end on the tonic. They are in verse  form. Duple and triple meters are used, sometimes changing to accommodate the  words, melody, or the singer’s unique style. The literature includes songs,  play-party games, and ballads. The most frequently heard vocal form from this  region is the ballad—a song that tells a story. Each singer sings a ballad in  his or her own personal way. Sometimes new words are sung to an old melody. A  ballad can be based on an event in history, a humorous situation, a tragedy,  happiness, a religious topic, a heroic deed, or the supernatural. Singing  ballads provided entertainment for hundreds of years for people who did not  have computers, TV, or radios. Because most of the original European settlers  of Appalachia could not read, the stories contained in ballads were used to  teach the history, ethics, and morality of the community. Characters in ballad  stories who broke the rules suffered in some way. Some examples of ballads are  &quot;Old Joe Clark,&quot; &quot;Barbara Allen,&quot; &quot;Mister Frog Went  A-Courtin’,&quot; and &quot;Sourwood Mountain.&quot;<br />
          <br />
          The southern Appalachian area is known for its instrumental traditions,  particularly the music of the mountain dulcimer, fiddle, banjo, and limberjack.  <img src="http://asiasociety.org/files/imagecache/large/fa7accb82807caaec1850302077b6237_0.jpg" alt="" width="182" height="150" align="right"/> <br />
          <br />
          The mountain dulcimer, one of the earliest North American folk instruments,  looks like a long, thin violin with frets and three or four strings. On the  mountain dulcimer the melody is played on the highest-pitched string, and the  other strings are the drones. To play the dulcimer, hold the instrument across  the lap. Use the right hand to pluck the strings with a quill, a pick, or a  finger, and press the strings against the frets to change melody pitches with  the left hand, or use a wooden slide.<br />

          <p><span class="style12">The fiddle was brought to America by settlers from the British  Isles. It was used as a solo instrument and to accompany dancing. The  Appalachian fiddle is often held against the upper chest, not under the chin,  and the bow is held a bit in from the end. This is also a very old position of  classical violin playing that has remained unchanged in the isolated  communities of Appalachia for many, many years. Modern classical violinists use  a chin rest and hold the bow differently. Sometimes rattlesnake rattles have  been placed inside the body of the fiddle for a percussive effect.</span><br />
            <br />
            <span class="style12">The banjo was brought to the southern Appalachian area by traveling minstrel  shows or by European Americans who learned to play the instruments from  enslaved African Americans while visiting plantations. The banjo is a fretted  instrument with a round body and five strings and is either plucked with the  fingers or played with a pick. Early banjos were modeled after a West African  string instrument of a similar design.  <img src="http://www.appalachianhistory.net/wp-content/uploads/image-import/coon%2Bcreek.jpg" alt="" width="241" height="189" align="right"/> </span> <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style12">A unique percussion instrument of Southern Appalachia is the limberjack—a  wooden doll-like figure attached to a stick on the back. The player sits on one  end of a board and suspends the doll over the free end of the board. When the  player hits the free end of the board it moves up and down, hitting the doll  and causing it to bounce around. The sound made by the bouncing wooden doll is  similar to that made by Appalachian clog dancers.</span><br />
            <br />
            <span class="style12">A look at the music of Southern Appalachia gives us a fascinating peek into the  past from the present. We can experience a living oral tradition that in some  ways has not changed at all from the time settlers came over from Europe long  ago. </span></p>

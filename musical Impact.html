	<p class="style6">    Most people don't realize the vast impact  music has on our lives every day. We are surrounded by music, yet most people  don't realize the vast impact it has on our everyday mental, physical, and  spiritual health.</p>
	<p class="style6">Modern researchers delving into why and how music affects our  minds and bodies have come up with some startling facts. For instance, music  creates changes in metabolism, circulation, blood volume, pulse, blood  pressure, and our moods. </p>
	<p class="style6">Doris Soibelman, author of Therapeutic and Industrial  Uses of Music, claims that nearly every organ in the body responds to music.<img src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSgcSXOaCWhe-_9mdhRqvtWy5AbW108cuCU4Vgy7wJ3wH0f4Szn" alt="" name="rg_hi2" width="278" height="181" align="right" id="rg_hi2" data-width="278" data-height="181" /></p>
	<p class="style6">Music can compel us to laugh, to cry, to  worship God. It can calm us or whip us into an emotional foot-stomping frenzy.  Playing &quot;our song&quot; can trigger memories and nostalgic moods.<br />
	  In the Bible, David calmed King Saul's moods  by playing the harp. Egyptians used music to calm their insane, and their  mighty pyramids. were built to the rhythmic beat of it.</p>
	<p class="style6">Different uses for music. Today programmed  music is used to make jogging, walking, and other exercises easier and more  fun. In a recent newspaper interview with a top high school runner, the athlete  attributed his running success partly to music. According to the article, the  runner tunes out distractions and gets the correct mind-set by picking the  right mood music and running with it.</p>
	<p class="style6">Today scientifically planned music greets us  everywhere and is used in hospital labor rooms and dentist offices to help keep  both doctor and patient calm.<img src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS5kNiJ9sRMPz5OK55b2KxlBjZ3qXYlVSCtVz5v0X9uJoJHhMYa" alt="" name="rg_hi3" width="146" height="163" align="right" id="rg_hi3" data-width="130" data-height="134" /></p>
	<p class="style6">Colleges and universities offer degrees in  music therapy, and almost every mental hospital has a trained music therapist.  Therapists say music often helps bridge the gap between reality and fantasy for  mental patients and can be an effective tool in controlling moods. Even when  minds are closed to all else, music will often break down barriers.</p>
	<p class="style6">In his book Music for Your Health, Dr. Edward  Podolsky lists several uses for music. For the nervous ulcer patient he advises  a half hour a day spent alone just listening to music of the patient's choice.  For tiredness he suggests listening to some Gershwin classics. If you're on  edge and need to calm down, he recommends tunes like Schubert's &quot;Ave  Maria&quot; or the tranquil Moonlight Sonata.</p>
	<p class="style6">Researchers have also found that lively music  can be effective in activating a slow pulse and that smoothing music can  sometimes have a calming effect on an overactive heart. Dwight Eisenhower is  said to have used Brahms and Bach to help him recover from a heart attack.</p>
	<p class="style6">Why we react, Why do our systems react to  music? Researchers believe that music gets to us because we are rhythmic  beings, with rhythm in respiration, heartbeats, brain waves, gait, and speech.  The impact of music appears to be in the way musical sounds reach and affect the  brain.<br />
    </p>
	<p class="style6">In 1896 an Italian physician caring for a  13-year-old boy who <img src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT9EKs51pKrkfQ1qV8JpC7cO_L_ensnnDZpJlBdM2mX8ZkanInfOQ" alt="" name="rg_hi" width="259" height="194" align="right" id="rg_hi" data-width="259" data-height="194" />had a healed skull wound through which brain pulsations  could be observed experimented with music. He reported that it did indeed  affect the pulsations of the brain. He noted that high notes seemed to produce  bigger changes than those of lower pitch.</p>
	<p class="style6">The late Dr. Ira N. Alschuler, a psychiatrist  and one time director of musical therapy at Wayne County Hospital in Detroit,  Michigan, reported that &quot;the mental and spiritual drug of music enters the  human being through the thalamus, a part of the brain that is the main relay  station for all emotions, sensations, and feelings. Thus music affects  moods.&quot;</p>
	<p class="style6">Scientists who have studied programmed music  have found that soft seductive music slows the circulation and reduces the  volume of blood that reaches the brain. Australian music researcher Harry Cox  says that driven or hyperactive individuals can sometimes be helped by tunes  played at a faster tempo and pitch than their own emotional state. Once a  person's attention is captured and he or she starts keeping time with the  music, patterns can be subtly changed to slower tempos, thus giving a sedative  effect.</p>
	<p class="style6"> The opposite technique has been used with an apathetic individual.  Music therapists have matched a patient's mood with music and then helped the  person alter his or her mood by gradual changes in tempo. It is a slow process  and must be administered by persons trained not only in music but also in human  behavior.</p>
	<p class="style6">Music in the workplace. In the everyday  working world, scientifically planned background music has been found to  increase production and cut down on boredom, fatigue, and tension. At a  Midwestern university a group of students participating in a musical research  project were assigned monotonous manual jobs that they did in silence. Then a  soft background music was added, and production increased 17 percent.</p>

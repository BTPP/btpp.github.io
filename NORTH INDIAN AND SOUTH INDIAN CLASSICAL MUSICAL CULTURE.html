      <p class="style23">NORTH INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSICAL CULTURE  <img src="http://www.sasnet.lu.se/bilder/poorva.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="159" align="right"/> </p>
      <p class="style23"><span class="style26">In  North India, the music is from the <em>Hindustani</em> tradition. The main melody  instrument is the <em>sitar,</em> a long-necked, wooden, plucked string  instrument with frets. The modern sitar has seven main strings that are tuned  differently, depending on the melody that is being played. The sitar is the most famous  Indian string instrument; many rock musicians, including the Beatles, have  studied it. It is similar in sound to the electric guitar. The <em>sarod</em> is another plucked string instrument of  Northern India. It has a wider neck than a sitar. The modern sarod has a  metal-plate fingerboard and it is plucked with a large plectrum made of wood,  horn, or coconut shell. Players slide their fingers on the strings, stopping  the sound by pressing down on the string with the fingernails or fingertips.  This fretless instrument is held across the lap. Often the sarod and sitar play  duets, but they can also be solo melodic instruments.  <img src="http://chandrakantha.com/articles/indian_music/saraswati_media/veena.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="173" align="right"/> <br />
<br />
People learn to play these instruments by studying with a <em>guru</em> (teacher). Students learn through imitation, not by reading notes. They learn  sets of melodic patterns with an underlying scale, called <em>ragas.</em> Each  raga has its own tuning, time of day, emotional meaning, and season of the  year. Ragas become the basis for long melodies improvised by the performers.  <br />
<br />
The sarod and sitar are accompanied by a long-necked lute  called the <em>tamboura.</em> It is similar to a sitar, but has four to six  strings. It plays a <em>drone</em> accompaniment with just two pitches tuned to <em>do</em> and <em>so</em> of the melody, and it has a shimmering sound.Another instrument from North India is the <em>sarangi.</em> It  is a bowed string instrument with four heavy main strings made of gut and up to  36 sympathetic strings. This fretless instrument comes from the folk traditions  of India.<br />
<br />
These instruments are accompanied by <em>tabla</em> drums. One  drum is made of wood, and the other is made of copper or clay. They are set on  cloth rings to hold them in place. The drumheads are made of goatskin that is  attached by leather thongs. The head of each of these two drums has three  distinct parts, which produce three different sounds.  <br />
<br />
Drummers spend 10 to 12 years learning to chant the different  rhythmic patterns that signal which drum and which part of the head they will  strike when they play. Once the chants are mastered, a drummer is allowed to  play them on the drums.Key North Indian wind instruments include the <em>shahnai,</em> a loud double-reed instrument that is usually played outside during ceremonies.  Other wind instruments include a bamboo flute and a small pipe organ.</span></p>
      <p class="style23"><span class="style26"><span class="style27">SOUTH INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSICAL CULTURE</span></span></p>
      <p class="style23"><span class="style26">Music  from South India is from the <em>Karnatac</em> tradition. The instruments are  similar to those of North India but are called by different names. The most  well-known South Indian plucked string instrument is the seven-string <em>vina.</em> It is carved out of a single piece of jackwood or blackwood and inlaid with  deer horn or ivory.  <img src="http://www.indianetzone.com/resize_image.aspx?MaxSize=150&amp;filen=2/images/carnatic-music_756.jpg" width="180" height="165" align="right"/> <br />
          <br />
The drum of South India is called the <em>mridangam.</em> It is  a barrel-shaped wooden drum with two heads, one at each end. The player lays it  flat on the floor between the knees and ankles and plays both ends of the drum,  which have special playing areas. The drum makes at least fifteen different  sounds, and the right-hand end can also be tuned to different pitches.South Indian wind instruments include the bamboo flute, a  double-reed instrument   called the <em>nagasvaram,</em> the clarinet, and a small pipe organ.</span></p>

        <h1 class="style10">GOSPEL CULTURE OF MUSIC</h1>
        <p class="style9">In the first few decades of  the twentieth century, many African Americans moved from the southern  countryside to northern cities. They brought their religious traditions with  them to the new urban setting. Congregants from small country churches found  their new spiritual homes in storefront city churches. Music for worship  centered on the folk spiritual, but with the addition of instrumental  accompaniment. This was a big change that led to what we call gospel music  today. Three styles of gospel music emerged: the gospel hymn, rural gospel  (sacred blues), and the Holiness-Pentecostal style.</p>
        <p class="style11">GOSPEL HYMN    <img src="http://static.newworldencyclopedia.org/thumb/0/0f/Oslo_gospel_choir.jpg/300px-Oslo_gospel_choir.jpg" alt="" width="178" height="150" align="right"/> </p>
        <p class="style9">Charles Albert Tindley  (1851â€“1933) was a Methodist minister in Philadelphia who developed the gospel  hymn style. Some of his hymns had their roots in European anthems that lent  themselves to choral responses. In his melodies, Tindley sometimes avoided the  third and seventh scale degrees to allow for improvisation of blue notes on  those degrees. He composed in the traditional call-and-response pattern in  verse-and-refrain form, but his instrumental accompaniments moved his work from  the spiritual category into the gospel category.</p>
        <p class="style9"><span class="style12">RURAL GOSPEL</span><img src="http://www.argentinaindependent.com/images/apr2010/gospel/gospel02.jpg" alt="" width="244" height="184" align="right"/></p>
        <p class="style9">The blues of rural areas of  the South found their way into church services in the urban North and became  gospel music. Religious lyrics were sung in blues style by a solo singer  accompanied by harmonica or guitar. Blind Willie Johnson and Blind Mamie  Forehand were two important rural gospel singers around the turn of the  twentieth century.</p>
        <p class="style9"><span class="style12">HOLINESS-PENTECOSTAL GOSPEL</span><br />
              </p>
        <p class="style9">A very expressive and  uninhibited worship style evolved in the new Pentecostal denomination in the  first decade of the twentieth century. The Holiness-Pentecostal gospel style  was close to the rural spiritual style with its singing and dancing. The use of  brass instruments, mandolins, and jugs added to the enthusiasm of these  worshipers and placed the music in the gospel category. Arizona Dranes was an  important Holiness-Pentecostal gospel performer. Her recordings exhibit her  trademark rhythmic ragtime piano playing and her vocal leads that could  sometimes be characterized as shouts.</p>
        <p class="style9"><span class="style12">CONTEMPORARY GOSPEL</span> <img src="http://images.quickblogcast.com/4/2/5/5/1/225622-215524/babangidapic25.jpg?a=49" alt="" width="306" height="197" align="right"/> </p>
        <p class="style9">Contemporary gospel groups  are usually made up of small groups of one soloist or four to six singers;  accompaniments are usually the same as the secular style the group embraces,  such as hip-hop, rap, jazz, or funk.<br />
          <br />
          A look at spirituals and gospel music reveals that although the musical style  of the folk spiritual has changed over hundreds of years , the core beliefs, strengths, and values of African American  culture are still intact as expressed in spirituals and gospel music</p>

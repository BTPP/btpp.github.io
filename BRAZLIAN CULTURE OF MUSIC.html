        <h1 class="style10">BRAZILIAN CULTURE OF MUSIC  <img src="http://crossroadsmag.eu/images/2008/feature/passatempo/brazil_kids.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="163" align="right"/> </h1>
        <p class="style10 style11">Brazilian culture is a  blend of many different cultures, including indigenous people who have lived  there for centuries; people of Portuguese descent who have come from the  Iberian peninsula of Europe since the late 1400s; and people of African descent  who were brought as slaves from West Africa. In addition to these groups,  immigrants from many different countries have come to work and live in Brazil  in the last 200 years. Over time, people from these cultures have intermarried,  forming a mixture of cultures and traditions, which the music and dance of  Brazil reflects.<br />
          <br />
          Hidden deep in many of the forests of Brazil are groups of the original peoples  whose cultures are ancient. Members of these groups are often hunters and  gatherers and live in the way people lived thousands of years ago. Their  musical instruments include various kinds of rattles, drums, whistles, flutes,  and horns. In addition to playing instrumental music, the people enjoy dancing  and singing. Their music often reflects their aural surroundings—it imitates  the sounds they hear. One ancient indigenous Brazilian language uses its word  for &quot;sound&quot; for all sounds, including musical sounds. These isolated,  indigenous cultures are not well known, and they have not influenced the rest  of Brazilian music. A contemporary singer and expert on Brazilian music, Marlui  Miranda, has collected and arranged a variety of songs from these ancient  cultures and recorded them on several albums.  <img src="http://www.celebratebrazil.com/images/Atabaque_Brazilian_Drum.jpg" alt="" width="107" height="156" align="right"/> <br />
          <br />
          The Portuguese influence in music is threefold. When the Portuguese people  arrived in Brazil, they had with them many European instruments, including the  flute, clarinet, a small, four-stringed guitar (that later became the ukulele  in Hawaii), guitar, violin, cello, accordion, tambourine, and piano. These instruments,  particularly the guitar, tambourine, and flute, have been used in much of  Brazil’s traditional music. The Portuguese brought from Europe vocal music such  as ballads, romantic songs, church music, children’s songs, and lullabies,  which were sung using the scales and harmonies common in Europe then. The <em>choros</em>  is the most popular song form in Brazil and  is accompanied by guitars, flute, clarinet, and mandolin. People enjoy dancing  to this music. Finally, the Portuguese brought with them the familiar rhythms  of their region of the world, including rhythms of the polka, the waltz, and  the march.  <img src="http://www.lexiophiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Picture-Marina-Big1.jpg" alt="" width="254" height="220" align="right"/> <br />
  <br />
          The African musical influence is very strong in Brazil and is found in the  instruments, rhythms, and dances that are enjoyed there. The most familiar  African instruments are various large drums, two-toned agogo bells, a variety  of rattles, and bowed instruments with a resonating gourd attached. Another  popular African instrument is the friction drum, which is a metal drum with a leather  head that is punctured by a stick wrapped in a wet cloth and moved up and down,  making a haunting sound. Much African music is used to accompany dances that  are included in rituals. The drums are considered sacred, and the drummer plays  a very important role in the rituals.<br />

      <p class="style12">Like  many North and South American cultural traditions, Brazilian culture is complex  and extremely varied, although some aspects have blended over hundreds of  years. </p>

        <span class="style8">New Delhi, April 7 (ANI): Seems like Oscar winner A R  Rahman is expanding his horizons. The music maestro is coming up with his own  production house. Buzz has it that his first movie will be a musical one.  Rahman had always wanted to produce films but due his busy schedule he was  never able to do it. It is said that Rahman's production house has plans to  diversify and produce films in all Indian languages. However it is still  uncertain if the film will be made in Hindi. An official announcement regarding  his production venture is still awaited </span>.</p>

    <p class="style9">The music video for Till The World Ends (the  Ke$ha-written song off of Britney  Spears' new album, Femme Fatal) is out! It features themes from all  of the artists that have been making music while Britney was driving with her  babies in the front seat with her and using umbrellas incorrectly, like the leotards of Lady Gaga and the underground terrains and arenas that we saw in Nelly  Furtado's Maneater.  This video (below) is rumored to be the director's cut, as numerous websites reported that two versions were shot: one where the  storyline revolves around the apocalypse, while the other one was to be the  &quot;unabridged version of Britney's dance moves.&quot;</p>
